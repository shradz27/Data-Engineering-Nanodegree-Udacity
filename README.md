Coursework for Udacity's Data Engineering NanoDegree

## Concepts

1. **Data Modeling**
- Create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. Use ETL to build databases in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.
  - Project: Data Modeling with Postgres
  - Project: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

2. **Data Warehouses**
- Sharpen data warehousing skills and deepen your understanding of data infrastructure. Create cloud-based data warehouses on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
